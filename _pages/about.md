Welcome!

I am a job market candidate at the Department of Economics, Ohio State University.

My research focuses on policy-relevant empirical questions in the fields of health and labor economics. In my research, I often combine unique administrative data in medical claims and unemployment insurance with reduced-form and structural methods.

I am on the 2022-2023 job market and will be available for interviews at the ASSA and EEA meetings.
