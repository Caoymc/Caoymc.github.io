Welcome!

I am a job market candidate at the [Department of Economics, Ohio State University](https://economics.osu.edu/). My main advisor is [Kurt Lavitti](http://kurtlavetti.com/).

My research focuses on policy-relevant empirical questions in the fields of **health** and **labor** economics. In my research, I often combine unique administrative data in medical claims and unemployment insurance with reduced-form and structural methods. Check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MHVYIxI-2ZNt0998RAfBXUstjNEWiEcm/view?usp=share_link) here.

My [job market paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xQbdR3X-gTzVhGdA05hUGzdf7wqeNGoX/view?usp=share_link) studies how incorporating joint dynamics of earnings and medical spending affect adverse selection in health insurance market and how to imporve subsidy policy designs. 

One strand of my future research will build on the insights of my job market paper and focus on topics related to health insurance subsidy policies using unique administrative datasets. I am also interested in investigating the impact of health insurance policies (e.g. Medicare, Medicaid) on peopleâ€™s health and labor outcomes. Check out my [research statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GWaz3ICFRe5X9PrrmaW0rFtvCBWHheEV/view?usp=share_link) here. 

**I am on the 2022-2023 job market and will be available for interviews at the ASSA and EEA meetings.**
