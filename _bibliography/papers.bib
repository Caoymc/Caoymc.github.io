  title={Earnings Dynamics and Selection in Health Insurance Markets},
  abstract={This paper investigates how incorporating earnings dynamics into an insurance demand model affects adverse selection in health insurance markets. Using a novel dataset that links Utah All-payer Claims Data to the earnings records, this paper empirically estimates a structural demand model that jointly considers earnings dynamics and medical risk. By reducing the importance of medical risks in demand for insurance, incorporating earnings dynamics reduces deadweight loss by 40%. Relative to a model that demand only depends on medical risks, incorporating earnings dynamics causes the equilibrium take-up rate to increase by 5.2% and premiums to decrease by 17.2%. Counterfactual analyses show that ignoring earnings dynamics in insurance demand overestimates the importance of subsidies in reducing adverse selection. In addition, targeting low earners reduces deadweight loss less than targeting median earners. These results suggest that the evaluation of public policies to reduce adverse selection can be improved by considering the joint dynamics of health and earnings.},

  title={Impact of low skilled immigrants on native teen fertility},
  abstract={In this paper, I study whether increased competition in the labor market due to immigrant inflows has encouraged native youth to avoid one type of risky behavior: teen fertility. Exploiting cross-city variation in immigrant concentration, an analysis of U.S. Census data between 1980 and 2000 suggests that low-skilled immigrant inflows are associated with a decrease in the likelihood of teenage girls becoming mothers, and responses are strongest among girls who are more likely to become low-skilled workers in the future.},

  title={The Dynamic Efficiency of Changes in Medicaid Generosity (with Kurt Lavetti and Nicolas Ziebarth)},
  abstract={We study the effects of the Utah Primary Care Network (PCN), a limited form of public insurance available in Utah since 2002. The creation of the PCN allowed Utah to expand Medicaid in a budget-neutral way by covering primary care and some emergency care but excluding inpatient and specialty care. We apply fuzzy regression discontinuity design to study the impact of PCN coverage on the short, medium, and long-run medical care utilization of enrollees. To do this, we construct a unique database of all inpatients, emergency, and ambulatory events at all hospitals in Utah linked to all-payer claims data, allowing everyone in the sample to be tracked for up to 5 years after PCN
enrollment. We first show that enrollees with income above the income eligibility cutoffâ€€for traditional Medicaid without diabetes or high blood pressure look very similar to their counterparts whose income is eligible for Medicaid, providing balanced treatment and control groups. We second that people with income above the eligibility cutoff, who are less likely to be eligible for Medicaid-a health insurance with better coverage, are more likely to use fewer inpatient, professional services in the first month and first quarter after initial enrollment.
