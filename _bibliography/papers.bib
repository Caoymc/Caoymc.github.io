  title={Earning Dynamics and Selection in Health insurance market},
  abstract={This paper examines the changes in adverse selection and welfare evaluation of policies in health insurance market if earning risk is considered. How increases in the earning risk distorts the willingness to pay for health insurance plans is ambiguous due to two opposing forces: (1) higher consumption risk increases the willingness to pay (2) more “expensive” insurance in terms of utility. Moreover, earning risk affects how protection from consumption floor also influences the willingness to pay. The heterogeneity in labor market dynamics further affect precautionary saving motivation, causing changes in willingness to pay. Using employer-employee matched administrative data on earning and medical utilization, I model the joint distribution of quarterly earnings and medical spending predictions by allowing health status transition and job mobility. I found that equilibrium insurance take-up rate is lower and equilibrium premium is higher when earning prediction heterogeneity is considered. Moreover, the impact of subsidy and mandate changes when earning risk heterogeneity is not considered.},

  title={Impact of low skilled immigrants on native teen fertility},
  abstract={In this paper, I study whether increased competition in the labor market due to immigrant inflows has encouraged native youth to avoid one type of risky behavior: teen fertility. Exploiting cross-city variation in immigrant concentration, an analysis of U.S. Census data between 1980 and 2000 suggests that low-skilled immigrant inflows are associated with a decrease in the likelihood of teenage girls becoming mothers, and responses are strongest among girls who are more likely to become low-skilled workers in the future.},

  title={The Dynamic Efficiency of Changes in Medicaid Generosity (with Kurt Lavetti and Nicolas Ziebarth)},
  abstract={We study the effects of the Utah Primary Care Network (PCN), a limited form of public insurance available in Utah since 2002. The creation of the PCN allowed Utah to expand Medicaid in a budget-neutral way by covering primary care and some emergency care but excluding inpatient and specialty care. We apply fuzzy regression discontinuity design to study the impact of PCN coverage on the short, medium, and long-run medical care utilization of enrollees. To do this, we construct a unique database of all inpatients, emergency, and ambulatory events at all hospitals in Utah linked to all-payer claims data, allowing everyone in the sample to be tracked for up to 5 years after PCN
enrollment. We first show that enrollees with income above the income eligibility cutoff for traditional Medicaid without diabetes or high blood pressure look very similar to their counterparts whose income is eligible for Medicaid, providing balanced treatment and control groups. We second that people with income above the eligibility cutoff, who are less likely to be eligible for Medicaid-a health insurance with better coverage, are more likely to use fewer inpatient, professional services in the first month and first quarter after initial enrollment.
