  title={Earnings Dynamics and Selection in Health insurance markets},
  abstract={This paper investigates how earnings dynamics affect adverse selection in health insurance markets. I model how individuals predict the joint distribution of quarterly earnings and medical spending by incorporating health status transitions, employment status, and employer transitions. I empirically estimate the model by combining Utah UI records and Utah All-Payer Claims Dataset, which allows me to observe individuals' quarterly medical spending, earnings, and their employers from 2013 to 2015. Finally, I apply the model estimates and find that the average willingness to pay in models with earnings dynamics is lower, especially for individuals with higher expected medical costs. Incorporating earning uncertainties causes a weaker relationship between willingness to pay for insurance and expected medical costs. By reducing the influence of private information about medical risks, earnings dynamics reduce deadweight loss by 40%. The equilibrium take-up is 5.2% higher, and premiums are 17.2% lower. Moreover, counterfactual analysis shows that implementing a uniform subsidy in models with earnings dynamics reduces a lower share of deadweight loss. These results suggest that the evaluation of public policies to reduce adverse selection can be improved by considering the joint dynamics of health and earnings. },

  title={Impact of low skilled immigrants on native teen fertility},
  abstract={In this paper, I study whether increased competition in the labor market due to immigrant inflows has encouraged native youth to avoid one type of risky behavior: teen fertility. Exploiting cross-city variation in immigrant concentration, an analysis of U.S. Census data between 1980 and 2000 suggests that low-skilled immigrant inflows are associated with a decrease in the likelihood of teenage girls becoming mothers, and responses are strongest among girls who are more likely to become low-skilled workers in the future.},

  title={The Dynamic Efficiency of Changes in Medicaid Generosity (with Kurt Lavetti and Nicolas Ziebarth)},
  abstract={We study the effects of the Utah Primary Care Network (PCN), a limited form of public insurance available in Utah since 2002. The creation of the PCN allowed Utah to expand Medicaid in a budget-neutral way by covering primary care and some emergency care but excluding inpatient and specialty care. We apply fuzzy regression discontinuity design to study the impact of PCN coverage on the short, medium, and long-run medical care utilization of enrollees. To do this, we construct a unique database of all inpatients, emergency, and ambulatory events at all hospitals in Utah linked to all-payer claims data, allowing everyone in the sample to be tracked for up to 5 years after PCN
enrollment. We first show that enrollees with income above the income eligibility cutoffâ€€for traditional Medicaid without diabetes or high blood pressure look very similar to their counterparts whose income is eligible for Medicaid, providing balanced treatment and control groups. We second that people with income above the eligibility cutoff, who are less likely to be eligible for Medicaid-a health insurance with better coverage, are more likely to use fewer inpatient, professional services in the first month and first quarter after initial enrollment.
