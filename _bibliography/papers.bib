  title={Earning Dynamics and Selection in Health insurance market},
  abstract={This paper investigates how heterogenous earning dynamics among potential applicants affect adverse selection in health insurance markets. I argue that earning dynamic heterogeneity dilutes the importance of private information regarding medical cost to insurers, because when heterogeneity in earning dynamics is considered, people who have lower expected medical cost could have higher willingness to pay for health insurance. Both demand curve and average cost curve could change, leading to changes in adverse selection. I first discuss how earning dynamics, including predicted earning mean, earning volatility, and the correlation between earning and medical spending, affect individuals' willingness to pay for health insurance. Second, using employer-employee matched administrative data on earning and medical utilization, I model how individuals predict the joint distribution of quarterly earnings and medical spending by allowing health status transition and job mobility. Then I apply the model estimates to a pool of potential applicants, and find that, at least in my context,  grouping people of heterogeneous earning dynamics leads to higher take-up rate and lower equilibrium premium.},

  title={Impact of low skilled immigrants on native teen fertility},
  abstract={In this paper, I study whether increased competition in the labor market due to immigrant inflows has encouraged native youth to avoid one type of risky behavior: teen fertility. Exploiting cross-city variation in immigrant concentration, an analysis of U.S. Census data between 1980 and 2000 suggests that low-skilled immigrant inflows are associated with a decrease in the likelihood of teenage girls becoming mothers, and responses are strongest among girls who are more likely to become low-skilled workers in the future.},

  title={The Dynamic Efficiency of Changes in Medicaid Generosity (with Kurt Lavetti and Nicolas Ziebarth)},
  abstract={We study the effects of the Utah Primary Care Network (PCN), a limited form of public insurance available in Utah since 2002. The creation of the PCN allowed Utah to expand Medicaid in a budget-neutral way by covering primary care and some emergency care but excluding inpatient and specialty care. We apply fuzzy regression discontinuity design to study the impact of PCN coverage on the short, medium, and long-run medical care utilization of enrollees. To do this, we construct a unique database of all inpatients, emergency, and ambulatory events at all hospitals in Utah linked to all-payer claims data, allowing everyone in the sample to be tracked for up to 5 years after PCN
enrollment. We first show that enrollees with income above the income eligibility cutoffâ€€for traditional Medicaid without diabetes or high blood pressure look very similar to their counterparts whose income is eligible for Medicaid, providing balanced treatment and control groups. We second that people with income above the eligibility cutoff, who are less likely to be eligible for Medicaid-a health insurance with better coverage, are more likely to use fewer inpatient, professional services in the first month and first quarter after initial enrollment.
